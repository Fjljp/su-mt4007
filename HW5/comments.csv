"... halfway in for the first time and... drake's insane, this didnt need no help to get big... also... i was fine listening to the clips i heard, but now ive actually heard the song favorite line is still comparing drake to a pdfile via a minor"
"If you are ten years old and listening to this, I congratulate you. Now go back to Slim Shady LP then follow it up with The Marshall Mathers LP and finish with The Eminem Show. Then you'll be pretty much caught up (in all the important ways). And again, congratulations"
Honestly not a bad song.

Little baby devil with the forked tongue (huh)
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him)
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work (haha)
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin' to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat? (Haha)
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like

Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro

Now, back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of copin', taste of opiates (mmm)
Case of OE turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy (ooh)
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse (yeah), it did start off lighthearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted, mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed, yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin'
And I've been runnin' at full speed and that's why I'm ahead like my noggin'
And I'm the fight y'all get in when you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin'
When I step up to that mic, cock it then: Oh my God, it's him! Not again!

Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)

Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like, happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)

So how many little kids still wanna act like me? (Haha)
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were bein' attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leanin' back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the Black Guy (Guy) Pees (haha, Pees)
In my Air Max 90s, white Ts, walkin' Parental Advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese (haha)
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser (haha), fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls big as RuPaul's (woah)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and, see, the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leavin' like

Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra', abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"

"So I had this idea for a bit, you show up at Ariana Grande's bed with a bicycle. And she wakes up and she says oh honey you look so cute in your Santa Claus's elf's outfit. She says is that bicycle for me? He says no it's for Pete and he points next to her, no this is for Pete. And she says who's Pete? and she looks over and Pete sits up and says oh God I knew this day would come. So Ariana gets up out of the bed like Lorraine Bracco in Goodfellas, and she starts throwing s*** at Pete.💖💓💝🎤."

"It wasnt the illuminati, it was Hayley Williams, who is apart of the illuminati. They blamed the Illuminati for something that she did. They put the eye there to steer you away from her doing what she did to him so everyone says the Illuminati got him so it takes the blame away from her, and putting mass deception on everyone to stop her from being held accountable with manipulated footage recorded of the so called ""real slim shady"" that they put out everywhere after telling him she was having sex with snoop dog 50 cent and Dr Dre while they were recording him suffering over it in his house and warping his mind with a hacked phone so he wouldnt speak out, in hopes he'd die because they all knew he loved her and exposed her after she recorded herself having sex over the sanity remix and was exposed. When word got out that she defamed him, the paramore discord server closed, and now the paramore news facebook page is closed, and theyve disabled their comments on instagram. They tried to call him a catholic and he hexxed her so they had to quickly take action and make this video to stop the false narrative that they made on live tv from sticking out like a sore thumb. Theyre pretending to cover for him of crimes he did not commit to make it more believable to save Hayley Williams reputation. Feel free to give the world some real justice and share this EVERYWHERE. The photo is the truth, the rest is lies and mass deception and damage control, and the victim doesnt have a voice nor millions of people or dollars to speak out for himself. If word ever got out that she was singing about a 🍌 her career would be over, thats the real reason they went after him as theres alot of money etc involved with her. The Illuminati is real and theyre capable of making you think whatever they want you to think. This is all planned out to save her career. Rest in peace Hayley Williams, the truths out now. And no, the vaccines are not safe and effective. The world is ran by top level deceivers who control what you can and cannot comment on, who control what you think, to stay in power. We are slaves, and this is how they stay in power, by altering your perception. THEY WERE THE ONES WHO TOLD YOU THE VACCINES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. SHARE THIS EVERYWHERE. #Thedeathofhayleywilliams"

Yeah, the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin, and I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best but ops I'm white-chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my god, it's him... not again!""
[Chorus: Eminem]
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

[Bridge: Eminem]
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say
(If what?) If he could see the way shit is today
(Look at this shit, man) He'd probably say that everything is gay
(Like happy!) What's my name, what's my name?

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group, the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world, 'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself, I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me what? Okay, that's it, go ahead, Paul, quit
Snake-ass prick, you male crossdresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that
(Watch) But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you, fuck my own kids they're brats (Fuck 'em)
They can screw-off, them and you all
You too, Paul, got two balls, big as RuPaul's, what you thought you saw ain't what you saw
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini, I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving, like
[Chorus: Eminem]
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh"
My condolences.
Its a very good bro😎

Я хуею)....

Hey, Em, it's Paul
Uh, I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck, you're on your own
Guess who's back, back again?

Guess who's back?
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da
Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like

Grifters gonna grift, if not he’d still be in that trailer he’s always rapping about escaping 😂. Always been trash music 🤷🏻‍♂️"

This song is hard bc my dad di*d when I was 2 years old so that is hard with out him but I will make him proud still my adhd and all my problems stop me. So it so hard for me but hope you understand me.
"Rather, what would Eminem of the 2000s say when he saw that Donald Trump was already president once and is being president again?"
Sin Dudas es Eminem 👈🇦🇷🇦🇷🫂💪
What does today's Eminem say about Donald Trump becoming president for the second time?
I lost all respect for this clown the moment he sold out to wokeness and went political. This is precisely why we no longer BUY their albums but rather download them off YouTube and distribute them for ourselves
"""my transgender cat's Siamese, identifies ad black but acts Chinese"""
this is guy from fortnite Just kidding i love you eminem

Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)

Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"

Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls

"Thoroughly disappointed in the recent stance shady took. Im forgiving him and giving the benefit of the doubt cause hes not a politician hes an artist thats brought amazing music to this planet, and I'm also a conservative republican. Keep on making music em! we love you no matter what"
It’s the guy from Fortnite !!!
Rest of the album was mid imo
This is at least 1000% better than most modern rap
Eminem. Trump hating POS
3:20 kaaaaaaaaa booooooooooom

I love how you can see that him and Dre are great friends. You know Dre had to fight hard to keep a straight face.
"This song got me fired up! Thinking we would get protestors for his lyrics and whatnot... 

Then he became woke as heck...

smh...Em killed his entire album...

 Ice Cube's Man Down is more hard-hitting than this!"
4:15 The reaction xdxd
That roll looked like it almost defeated him.
NGL the girl at the star when slim shady is leaving the portal looks like a fortnite skin
"I find it amusing and interesting how this video shows the two different eras of Eminem's career.  I do think that the Emimen of 2002 would be stupefied by some of the shit that goes on now.  In 2002 social media didn't exist, there was no AI as we understand it today and the internet as a whole wasn't this pervasive entity it is today."
"1:11 younger Eminem 
(Lmao)"
How can anything change when you have blonde hair? How is that possible (: It's so nice to see you and I can't believe you're still growing. 😘

The failure of Infinite inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady
"Боже, це прекрасно.

Хай ідуть на те, що смокчуть,  псевдокритики з їх клоунськими недооцінками, альбом бомба.

Я давно так не кайфував. Бог, безперечно, Бог репу, кращий, неповторний, цікавий, технічний, смішний, доречний.

Хто не викупає - слухайте цвіркунів, інше для вас перебор."
"Funniest shit i heard in a long time, love you marshall ❤ awesome!!!!"
"hey emenim ive got song lyrics hope you like this it took a long time
Verse 1:

Yo, it's Shady, the name that changed the game,
From the trailer park to the stage, they all know the name.
Spitfire bars, yeah, I came out the flame,
Every struggle, every hustle, just to build up my fame.

Mom’s spaghetti, but I made it with grit,
Dissed the critics and the haters, never gave ’em a hit.
Slim Shady in the game, now they all gotta quit,
Had the world doubting me, but now I’m built for this.

From 8 Mile to the top, I took it all in stride,
With a pen and a pad, it’s the only way I ride.
No surrender, no retreat, no place to hide,
I'm the real Slim Shady, you can't take my pride.

(Chorus)
Eminem, the name, the legend in the game,
Risin’ from the ashes, never fallin' to the same.
With every verse he spits, he’s takin’ his aim,
In the rap game, it’s Shady, they all know the name.

Verse 2:

Battles on the mic, yeah, I’m known for the fight,
Told the world my pain, gave ‘em the raw insight.
Haters wanna tear me down, but I’m outta sight,
I’m a king in this game, and I’m ready to ignite.

From ""Lose Yourself"" to ""Stan,"" made you feel the pain,
Every rhyme’s a weapon, every lyric’s insane.
Life's a twisted game, but I’m breakin' the chain,
I’m the voice of the broken, never scared of the rain.

Had to rise above it all, through the doubt and hate,
Now I’m sittin’ at the top, but I never forget my fate.
Embraced the struggle, used it to elevate,
And now I’m Shady, the greatest to ever narrate.

(Chorus)
Eminem, the name, the legend in the game,
Risin’ from the ashes, never fallin' to the same.
With every verse he spits, he’s takin’ his aim,
In the rap game, it’s Shady, they all know the name.

(Bridge)
Not afraid to speak, not afraid to fight,
Made it through the storm, now I’m shining in the light.
From battles with myself to battles on the mic,
Every scar, every tear, just a part of my life.

(Outro)
So here’s to the King, the one who changed the sound,
With every word I drop, I’m breakin’ new ground.
Eminem, Shady, forever holdin' it down,
In the rap game, they all know, I’m wearin’ the crown."

"He owes it all to Kathy Griffin not Not a real Dr Dre,  Nice planning getting that discount before the shit drops I guess"
Never beefed with an honest opponent. Just tomato cans like Jake Paul does. He's aight tracks suck though as usual. Been almost 30 yrs make way go home..lol

Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like

I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)

Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""

What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)

Em the album you gave the fans is what they have been wanting from you for a while & even though you done what you wanted to do for your last album telling yourself fk it i want 2 do me without feeling that if its going down with this fkn cancel culture but people all around the world do not want woke people chatting crap its only 25% tops around the world woke agenda is not the way forward they just have the loudest voice in the room & the people pushing it going out of business & stay away from politics because the people that wanted you canceled is the 1 your helping out most of the black community had enough of been used & taken granted for Trump won the election with the populure vote because the world wanted trump bk because he cares for americans even though they have been lied 2 about him liberals have notting good to offer & america knows that now anyway bk 2 the best part of you is shown in this album great job you are bk as far as rap fans as the G.O.A.T nobody has come close to what you gave to music full stop thank you respect from ireland

And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like

Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro

Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""

Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)

So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like

Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"

"Always funny until your not.  Always deep until a cheap shot.  Never where this world would go but to bounce away if I see big money or a hoe.  I never see this city they all say.  I never see this city they record.  Saw a black vehicle with a huge light that was a triangle on top.  Had to go had to go see some surf rock.  Never know why I wait outside it is if I don't see people come in and out I will never go inside.  They say the cheap bucket car will not do but that fast car fleet seems to be owned by the supernatural, fame, and the zoo.  Looks like the area of the city is empty today looks like I got to go too enjoy the conversation around you and the people walking around acting like zombies that know only how to use a smart phone for photos or porn."

I appreciate that he is not out acting like he's still 18 years old unlike Madonna and others who are totally destroying the prior memories. Her concerts look like a joke and she cannot keep up with what they want her to do. Let the good memories live on. Please! We all get old and it appears to be her worst nightmare... but ... what do i know 😂😂
The ahhhhahhhahhh at 1:32 lmfao GO CRAZY AHHH AHHHH AHHH AHHH AHHHH!!!!!

"""Just got his license back !?"" The look on Slim's face !"
He dissed his own kids... wtf !?!?!
Fighting himself. And winning... lol
Coke is heathly for ya but the rightfully grown crop
Or some actually good coke not just motorcycle bakin soda and winnin like these freaks do
Eminem  I love your music
Thats all it comes down too
What and who looks better in this or that Ill tell ya what we all really are is Animals that are supposed to wear the right colors.
To be ourselves in our animal forms and to live in oeace with God and doin this mission finally right.
Seriously give me the right love and help right now.
There just colors everybody whos makin us all hate em more. We love the colors when thier on paper or our clothes
Please smart people understand what I wrote.
What else besdies the very  Excruciating pain in hell forever. The more people that scream from the tops of thier lungs in it forever
I dont wanna just create people to die you cant even imagine how much worse hell is forever if we fail this mission forever. God NEEDS ME NEEDS the right love and help now. Last Message.
Like happy😂😂😂
Bill palmer and dan palmero are the same as him too.
His names steven humphrey. That kid hates us all and only wants all of our excruciating pain forever. Ask what does it want Gods throne for. Yeah you do steve all you wanna do is enslave me to death. For what
To hear all of our excruciating pain forever and to say it only deserves to be him for some reason oh beacuse hes the pure evil one and greedy. Well guess what I found the evil one.
Abracadabra... you are back and better than wine!
GUESS WHOS BACK!!!!!
Idk why steve only hates me and only believes in killin me cause thats what Satan does he wants to steal Gods throne to do what with it
Im normal after sex ask the girls Ive had sex with already Im ready to be happier and do this mission finally right now
And if you people finally listen to me it will be.
So shts better be hittin the fan now then cause this mission isnt bein done right unless your Perfect God which is me only doin it right so far.
And this has to be his help only. The Person you all wanna call houdini in this very song
But get me around the right people which is Bats and Wolves no matter what fukn color they are to do it
What it means is I can Create a Perfect Kingdome where all races can be accepted.
Ask why every Perfect Love or Sin always trimuphs over the other cause the Son is greater then the father unless you all listen to me and what we can do about this mission.
Unchained soul abominations are Purple Wolves. Who looks better around em then me so far with those Hats on.
I want the best for us all I wanna save us all. Born out of sin or Perfect Love of Births or not. God is the only true saviour. Not satan so far.
Or am Supposed too.
How about every song talkin about me trying to do this mission right again. Havent I proved it enough to Red itself that I am Almighty and can do anything.
Thats why everything exists like it does. Did God not make Crocodiles or snakes or every God dam Animal in every person somehow enough not to prove it. Give me real love and help before its too late
All its gonna really be is pure Darkness and screamin in very excruciating pain forever. Nothing else cause our God or Santa Claus or Lord Jehovah is not a failure.
What are they achieving goin against me and it. Watchn all of our souls suffer beyond Imagination forever and I can bet too you wont even see that. Its just gonna be and you can mark every word I say its just gonna be pure Darkness and Suffering very very very excruciating pain forever
Its all of real Gods hard work if you dont wanna hear me Boast too much about it. Satan is pure evil and only worthless and so is ALL of his help
Its the only religeous thing that Matters that always triumphs and is always right.
Please somebody with intelligence of what Im sayin right now including our Bible. Its our Bible do you people really think it doesnt Matter at all. Its our Bible.
Get me home I need M and Ms help with this Mission I am Red and Green too
Blame Satan hes the real problem that makes us all live for no reason and accept him as God forever. What does that kid really want go ahead and ask him.
Its sin when ur goin against me and the Bible this whole time on purpose. Thats when sin meets what we call love too. Then how come there are heavenly bodies and Perfect Births on this earth until now.
He hates everything he hates everybody how doesnt anyone notice that at all yet.
Satan cant all hes described as is worthless in the Bible. Satan is a worthless terrorist who only wants to see us all suffer in very excruciating pain forever. You wanna know what happens first steve the earth will be completly flooded then turn to Ice then be a burning nothing you can see ever again star Cold Star forever. And all the burning stars will fall forever and freeze solid too
🫨🫨🫨
And thats who I describe myself as in the Bible. If they dont wanna do this mission here we dont have to do it here. Let me have Ms help then instead. Ill show you all how to create a Paradise we can all live and take care of eachother in forever.
Jesus wants to sleigh red dragon or satan not ME Lord Jehovah.
Theres a whole new world up there.
Someone here in 2025?
That kids the real satan all satan wants is to live in hell forever you people arent understanding the Bible like whats needed.
New Life means Heaven on Earth.
Im Red and Green. Red and Green represents New Life.
steven humphreys a terrorist from the Bible who else is red dragon. Idk anyone else that is.
He said I would be too late and no Man will have an ear for ME.
Before its too late. And that's what Jesus told me too.
And he's makin us all those worms that are gonna be pure suffering forever. Give God the right help he actually needs.
It's from pure evil and that's what Satan really is.
Do you think what I'm sayin isn't true so far. Look at how evil and deadly this planet already is not even just by nature.
"D.R.E. still d.r.e. :p
eminem houdini 😎"
All that's gonna happen is we're gonna squiggle in pain forever like Worms and no way to change it all back.
Where he does do this mission right.
Well I'm gonna move out next month and we're gonna find Santa Clauses real home.
You all better care cause Steven humphreys the real Satan I know everybody wants to pretend it doesn't Matter at all but it does in the Bible for some reason. All this kid wants is to laugh at all of our excruciating pain forever even if you can't even hear him doin it.
If he doesn't wanna help me I'm movin there.
I'm movin to Detroit first then Las Vegas.
If it doesn't happen be ready for the most excruciating pain you've all ever felt forever. If it doesn't work.
Let Barbarass flee the Cross I'm goin home.
Cant do this mission here. All they care about is enslavin me to death.
Can I go to Detroit first scream for Ms help and if it doesn't work go on a vacation to Las Vegas. Cause we really can't do this mission here not around steve we cant.
Obviously I'm never gonna do this mission not here I cant.
3:11 is weird and funny
Please pick me up here M.
I have a clean body and a clean mouth please let me go home.
Nunca van a poder como eminem
Please sign ME.
I can rap anything.
I wanna go home and live with Bats ONLY.
Get me outta here.
I need real love and help now if you want me to be Santa Claus someday. Not this help ANYMORE Serious as a Fukn Sin is now.
I don't want these peoples help anymore all they do is prey on me to die all the time. The laws don't even have to Matter unless my names involved and it's what they always wait for like steve does.
If I havent proved it enough yet I'll die right now
I'm the only real one creating all that love and happiness for what to suffer beyond Imagination forever.
So you really don't wanna meet and sign me huh after all that I've done for us all.
bruh lmao
hears them 🐓ing?
No one will give me a place to sleep
I'm about to die if you don't.

If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)

"First off Paul officer bixbiy just kidding about the crossdressing lady foot wear, but you can handle a poke, anyways it's rumored that Harry Houdine was much more than a carnival performer, or a mere showman but was actually a sitting commander of the highest distinguished group that actually is the prioritize organization who established the illuminati organization, the order of the templer orient,, but i ya i might of contributed to the rumor but if it's fact, its not a rumor and i haven't overstep in the corespondents of the calabotory, Right,, but pretty sure he was a ordained suffix of the O.T.O  the most powerful group of distinguished men and women, like donetela Versace ❤❤"
He has better AI in this video for Slim Shady than multi million dollar movies. JS.

Praying for u Marshall. ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is his best music video yet 🤣
Eminem is so great that I don't care about his political affiliation and never will because I'll never know which side I'm talking to and that could be a death wish. And his music is always dope.
"Salvation

""That's good; I get what you are trying to say if we had a conversation. But try to speak a little bit more clearly; it's hard to interpret what you said based on the audio recording.

(verse 1)
""I understand you in context, but please enunciate more clearly; the recording makes your message hard to decipher.""That is nice like a lighter,bursting in flames whenever,that is what this fighting is all about?

(verse 2)
My rhymes are precision, no distortion or haze
I'm the voice of reason, in this verbal maze
You want to ignite, but your flow's gone dry
My flames are rising, and your message will die

(chorus)
You want to ignite, but your flow's gone dry
My flames are rising, and your message will die.

That is your opinion, belongs to you. I mean who can be you but you? Likewise, for me the flames have already been ablaze, action must be taken before its too late!

(verse 3)
Action, you demand? Bring it, let's collide
My rhymes are razors, sharpened, side by side
Too late? Nah, we're just getting started, friend
Your blaze will wither, as my verse ascends

(verse 4)
Metaphorically speaking, we are already at the point of no return. It's late. Let's salvage what is left and stop this fighting; it's a waste of time.

Time to sheathe the razors, and lay down our pride
Let's forge a new path, where our words can reside

""Lumifuse that is what will forever remain in sight,better get that right...(verse 4)
perhaps it starts with two, in one room's space
A glimmer of empathy, a willingness to replace
Hostility's armor, with vulnerability's might
And recognize our shared humanity, shining bright

I can conclude this because most of my actions tend to be misunderstood.But,as the old saying goes, ""Never said nobody warned you about the fuse!""

Lumifuse is the way khatoblivia will always stay the same(outro)"
"hands down the best rapper, the meaning of hard work and talent combined"
"Shady *I’ll be right back*
Eminem *Shady’s dead*
Also Eminem *I am still Slim, booth!*"

Eminem: How do you fellow kids
"""Guided Light""

- Verse 1 *
The Reckoning's near, no room for pride
Humility's key, to Allah's side
Strengthen your physicality before the time comes
Then people won't be saying 'I wish I had done'

- Chorus *
Islam is more than rules and rites
Fasting, prayer - it's a spiritual life
Not just a to-do list, you feel me?
Move to the beat, let your spirit be free

- Verse 2 *
When I first started, this verse I did start lightly
But I'm the kind of guy that moves while they are debating
Debating over? Silly things that you would not believe!!
Don't ever say you did not know when you are judged
Your body WILL betray you on that day

- Chorus *
Islam is more than rules and rites
Fasting, prayer - it's a spiritual life
Not just a to-do list, you feel me?
Move to the beat, let your spirit be free

- Verse 3/Bridge *
We're past the point of no return
Wake-up call, no more concern
Think for yourself, don't pretend
Forehead on the ground, humility to amend

- Chorus *
Islam is more than rules and rites
Fasting, prayer - it's a spiritual life
Not just a to-do list, you feel me?
Move to the beat, let your spirit be free

- Outro *
السَلَامُ وَرَحْمَةُ اللَهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ

"So....  Marshall,. How are you doing? 💖."
"Hey, Em, it's Paul
Uh, I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck, you're on your own
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da
Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"

"Eminem is the only rapper that say the whole truth about today's world : ""My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)

4.33 what was that😂
"Hey guys ,I want to tell you something ,I just found out after a long investigation from I was a kid I just found out something , many of the artist you know especially the ones in iluminati is actually working for the government ,and in ways you would not believe , moastly they are snitches ,they get to do their own dirty buisness if they rat out other criminals ,they may have contact with big cartels to ,then they tell the police where to find drugs and stuff ,so they can keep an cartel or criminals from ever get as big as for instance , Pablo Escobar,and yes Pablo may went a bit over the line but yet still he served the people ,but the government manufactured him the worst way possible, of course the power went over his head but there are many other ( criminals) out there fighting for our rights , but artist like Eminem,Dr Dre, whiz, Rihanna,  vybz cartell and all people under him , and so many more artist and well known actors and so on really working with the police , and it's so many other things you do not know ,there is a cure for cancer ,but the government do not won't it to exist a cure for cancer or viruses,the whole thing is death they want to controll everything and make Shure there is only rich people getting these things so they can make a thon of money ,not any government in any country in the world is really for the people ,belive me! Fight the system with me speak up for yourself and your rights ,and do it now people! , and the ting with vybz cartell being in jail is just for the show for people to believe he is not with them ! Believe me!"

"It took 22 years for Slim to appear again in a skin-tight costume and let his thing play. Osama and Dre back then, now just Dre and the fight against himself. How quickly time flies. 22 years have passed and he's still rapping like he did back then.#RapGod"

Idol worship to pick out certain few... Is what Jennifer Anne Pruitt means
"I admit it!  
I bought the pee wee football team a trophy.  The third year around the parents there is already animosity towards my son and other children continue receiving trophies for particular plays.   At this young age does it really matter if everyone got a trophy not.  
 The point is the parents animosity towards those who are picked out and given special trinkets.... Sounds like idol worship to me"
Eminem is trash 😂

2020 : Eminem

"Im 54 yrs old.  And i still love his music,     he is more handsome then ever.   ❤❤"
♿🚻
It really sux you sold out and backed Kamala just because she paid you 1.2 million dollars. I loved your music. Ur just a sellout now.
"Eminem actually raps faster than time, he did find time travelling while rapping!"
2002 to 2024 what a time travel :)
1:18 cool
"1.8million from Harris to tell you why you shouldn't trust white millionaires. What a sellout, fake, spineless flop"

Shane Gillis? What a 22nd chromasome LEGEND.
"Remember when this dude was a good rapper saying he would kil himself if he was one of those old rappers trying to hold onto his fame past his 20's....... Isn't this dude in his 40's or 50's or something.

This guy used to be good now he's doing white dudes for Kamala Harris adds, supports the gayes woke stuff and tries to act like his edgy or something, bro are you not rich enough to even keep to ur own words and standards and just quite before you've completly destroyed the legacy of your first two albums, like bro come on."

Il video è per caso contro le auto elettriche?
Amazing
Eminem endorsed Kamala. He’s officially not homophobic!
I do t want to dethrone eminem just set a bar. We both clear of. So he knows to pee on no electric fence. I dont even see rappers as human my mind so fast. I see them as mash potato
Lets see if Eminem wont rap battle me or anyone. So lets see if elon can do AI for speed intel  longentivity with relivence. While listening and writing this my mind alreadt we roye crushing rap crap got me scales ahead of eminem. And everyone knows im 100
Eminem im going to get you knocked up homie . 50 cent got cents or common  arrow thst way ◀️ just playing dog. Hey i let you use my matterual you got to welcome it back .
Sellout fake ahh jim brady
He's baaaaaaaaaack❤
"Hey long time fan, love your music. BUT since it’s ok to pay people to do/say dumb shit I was paid 5$ to tell all your fans that you need to do past research, em may be a good father now but back in the day he used to do/say some pretty horrible things. You think “grab her by the p**sy” is bad then you should listen to his music more carefully. My mom wouldn’t even let me listen to him until I was a teenager and she still hated it. Best rapper alive is lil Wayne, Royce shit sounds better then yours and the majority of your peers in the business will never accept you."
He’s a skinny wimp always trying to look tough. Never works. Still looks like a total wimp.
Wow this clip is beautiful...
3:53 this is a bit cursed
Best of 2024❤
King is back👑
1:32 if you listen closely there's a Just Lose It reference in em's annoyed scream
fun fact u can like comments by double tapping them and reply by tapping them three times
"Eminem you are a sell out and an idiot. And that pains me because I've liked your music since I was a teenager. 
Trump ❤ America has spoken."
Typ hard lmao and funny best thing he maid in years
"Hi Em, Leanne Ryan here from Ireland 🇮🇪 looking to see how I invoice you for previous work done.  Plz help I need this ❤"

OMG SHADY I LOVE YOUUUUU
Anyone here 2002?
"""When you gonna fly private and land on that dick"" - lmaooo. I just love that these 90s legends still cool af and i'm sure they get pussy but they never did no weird ass shit. I'm an immigrant and just got citizenship, a lot of people think that makes them American all of a sudden.... NO WAY!. I was stealing CDs from Sears and shit just to listen to Em. Now I'm actually paying because I can afford it and have a solid sound system so I want the ORIGINAL shit. Em is a 100% real one man, you can tell by how much his daughter loves him and is proud of her father. That shit is rare man, and really expains everything. If a Father's daughter is that cool, humble, smart and grounded.... Isn't that every parent's dream man? Like wtf?! This is the GODAMN GOAL RIGHT?! So rare to be that high level celebrity yet also keep your personal life personal, and I feel weird even talking about it and I could probably go on forever about how Relapse got me through inpateint rehab, but I won't even go there. Em is just a very SOLID HUMAN BEING MAN! THANK YOU bro, hopefully you see this cuz you helped me man. Thank you."
Was the new driver Typical Gamer😅
Always was listening Eminem.But after you give your vote to Hamala.  RIP  you peace of sh...
"Mo'fa' sampled his own track?! Damn, that's rap God Mode."

Above and beyond ft Richard Bedford — sun and moon (blastoyz extended remix ) 😔

He’s a ghost
Sell out!! Just 1.8mill to endorse kamala?? That's just how much you worth Marshall? But im sure Trump can understand it in business view. its a good business... But from moral point view..you just trash ...Trump 2024 Em!!!
Where did he live right now...trump win right...
The 63% Dislikes are from Gen Z to trying Cancel Eminem.
You why diddy has not targeted him is because he is a rap god and he has back up EM/RAP GOD

Fuck kid was personal 😂
I thought he peaked long ago
I love this song
RELLY GOOD EMINEM
All I know is Eminem is a big bitch that can’t do it himself and he’s got to sacrifice people or get help from the industry who wants that as a top person I don’t I’d rather see someone independent that is the rap God😈
3:04 to 3:17 is amazing 🙏🙏
I had to unlike to like again
Don’t hate on Eminem he saved us and warned us about Duffy

"Yeah is time! who dare to say only devil diddy owns the rap world? Diddy really don't give a fuck damn and yet continue all his fucking dark business but he has forgotten who is the real Masters of the real rap world, thats' rite Dr Dre & Snoop Dog & Eminem & 50cents are back to thrash the sucker fucker gay diddy down to close up his ass demonic empire"

I’m 10 I’ve listened to about every single music video Eminem has made☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
"watched ""late night with the devil"" and the demon abraxas was mentioned with connection to the word abracadabra. abaraxas is a demon who craves an audience and fame. i think slim shady is a servant of the demon abraxas and this song is saying he is no longer using that demon to gain fame"
3:04 sometimes I wonder what the old me say if what if he could see how shit is today

The best
The only rapper that has hasn't done his own type of video in over 5 years
"Slim shadys's so cool even the priest said ""Guess who's back"" lol"
Everone a rap called crucified is faster than any of eminems songs
Well look what the stork brung thats why im an eminem fan forever
"Eminem is a sell out! Hes not Detroit hes Hollywood woods elite! He's never done nothing for the city of Detroit Michigan but claim it to give himself street cred, and give him a pass in the then all black business of rap music! Living in Detroit doesn't make you billy bad ass! If you live on the east side its because your broke and cant afford to live anywhere else! Or your just a drug addict. Hea really got you people fooled! I was once blind myself but thank God, Jesus opened my eyes and now i can see! Juat remember if youre 19 thia guy is old enough to be your papa and your jamming out to an old man still singing the same song and dance, (song and dance) see what i did there."
GUES WHO’S BACK?????
cancel speedrun
1:12 nah ok ok💀💀
"He tried real hard to get cancelled endorsing Cameltoe Hairs. This dude needs to hang it up. Your done man, just a 50 yr old white dude now. Super sad to be honest."
It will go billions mark my words
"Hey, Em, it's Paul
Uh, I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck, you're on your own
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da
Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"
Bro top G NO CAP

2 god of rapping fight Eminem and slim shady
1:07 are those the same girls from without me
Snoop Dogg at the beginning + Fortnite at the billboard when Rap Boy climbed the building.. easter eggs related to Chapter 2 Remix? 👀
Losing his self

Creeedooo
Liberal sell out
He is legend
"Love, lol"
Tuvimos nueva canción de Eminem antes que GTA VI
So
This song give me so much power ....Thanks on the magic boy ...We see us
Beste nummer met mockingbord
Mork and Gork fighting each other coz no other Gods can stand up to them.
"Slim

Side when what 
Wasn’t me
5 o
Can you please understand me now"
"When I move 
You move 
Just like that"
O great a green screen kid
I love Dre and Em's friendship
I hear you Jesus not them!!!!
What in the name of God ☠️
I love eminem so
So disappointing and sad he supported Kamala.   No coming back from that.   Shouldn't have ventured into politics.  Retire now!  Lost a lot of fans!
Eminem Slim Shady are the same
Ez mil is there wow congrats
"Guess who’s back, back again, Trump is back, tell a friend 😂🔥💀"
🔥🔥🔥✌️😎✌️🔥🔥🔥
Slim Shady had to die because he dissed Eminem's kids
ABRA CADABRA 🗣️🗣️‼️‼️🔥🔥
3:25 Eminem shady😂
"We all can agree eminem, even now, it's still the most powerful rapper that ever existed, but we all know people are gonna keep on hating and start talking to s***, so to those people shut the f*** up already"
2024
Guess who smilling with this song?? 😊
0:43
Enimem met him old self ???
Bros complaining about wokism and supported the people who wanna censor him 😭😂

The best time of my life ❤ Love U❤
🔥🔥🔥
1:32 wow that nostalgia scream from his old track Just Loose It
1:36 this part goofy😂
2:34 I saw Fornite in the billboard😂
OK
"Feminem, jester of the PDFile elites. Diddy party regular. Kamala lap dog. What a fall from grace. CRUMB!"
lol Shane Gillis made this video !!!! Boys made it haha
Only Em DOES support the party of censorship now. The media and liberals have non-stop lied and try to censor any and all Republicans for years now so if you support Kamala you do support taking away people's freedoms. Which party tried to force everyone into their homes and was actively taking down all legitimate concerns about the vaccine during covid? 🤔
3:04 slaps so harddddd!!! 🫶
Best part 3:04
😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
how did he make this as slim shady is just past him
Veeeeeryyy goooooddddd !!!!!!!!
Nice song as usua; ...eminem on track again .
Funny ass video bra.😂
"If it sucks and it's boring because it can't be masturbation, Enter Sandman, or this crap?
Criminal world will always have to roll the dice, since they're so bad at everything in the first place.  Only the NFL'ers besides the QB and that fast black guy on the wing who only needs big biceps will die for practicing the wrong thing first, on their teams.  Well, first, anyways, since all of the rest started off being the youngest even betters in their neighborhoods first, and they'll never have to care about anyone else because of it for sure anymore, after the NFL.  Hah, that UFC heavyweight who put his photo of himself alone on a football field in a stadium with his belt over his shoulder on the internet!"
Snoopy DOG???
Snooppppppppp dogggggg 0:34
"Love your music, I'm Sheryl Adler from Necedah Wisconsin 🎉"

You mean Dre is about to pull you out of his bag?
"who else is watching this for free? how are these big artists getting paid? We know how Tom McDonald is getting paid. He's a great rapper but nobody ""sells records"" anymore. Certain artists are paid to play. Owned. Bought and sold. You don't think a huge commercial artist like your boy here is clean do you? He's not a sell-out?"
Dude wants to complain about censorship in his raps but politically he supports it and we're not supposed to notice this. Gtfoh
H8 this 🥷🏻

Saiu da minha playlist com certeza!"

This was amusing in 2002
Slim would be so disappointed to see Eminem endorse Kamala
Vaaaaauuu Respect 🎉😮
This whole song talks shit about Cancel and Censorship Culture and i love it😂
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Tl8E0Vvms Eminem works and the new age mumble Rapper looks as little Children.
"Eminem. If ever someone from production reads my message. Can you please let me get in studio and tell you what fans of you like me want to hear from you, Idk if I will achieve. I could tell you what we don’t want. And I talk in my name but I think we the same. We want changes we want roller coaster no flat. We want roller coaster. You used to come on the mike giving us up and down, swing left to right, get our head dizzy by listening. I can’t tell you what to do coz u the artist, but I can tell you what I don’t want to hear. Flat repeatiitions. Anyway I wish I get an answer and can come to try coz imo it’s a waist of your time and your fan time this flat repetitions. Not criticising for no reason. Fan from the start to the end. Just sad that no one able to tell you with heart towards better direction. Not know how to get answer from here. You can call the drunken admiral in Hobart, I work there. Ask for Flo. I call u back."
I'm a Pac fan but this guy's off tha hook anyone dissing em in hiphop is just racist
abra abracadabra <3

It's so cool of Shane Gillis to make an appearance in an up-and-coming artist's music video! Can't wait to hear more from this m'n'm guy!

Kamala Harris
Was a life long Fan until he endorsed Kamala. BYE BYE EM! TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!

"Haha Harris lost, Eminem you're FIRED, pack your bags if you don't like it, buh bye 🖐️"
Back From Fortnite Again 😂❤
3:01 the funniest part
😂 I feel this.
"THIS IS FOR U BRO ook, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""Bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay, I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"" That's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""Way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""Hell, yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause-
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton-, no, Asgard, Asgard
So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a .9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop, "" 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head, there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard, be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?

"This is one of those songs that in five years you look back on it and go ""damn"""
"Since Kamala didn't work smart, she will have to work much harder if she wants to run again.  Working hard is not one of her characteristics.  She will have to work smart to win again, I don't know if people will give her a 2nd chance with such a big loss.  Eminem says you have 'one shot', she blew it.  Same with Eminem in 8 Mile his 1st time.  The difference between Eminem and Kamala is that Eminem works much harder than Kamala."
"David hurcombe died, suicide my brother from his music. im still waiting for payout, but that's rock bottom"

viste me numa guerra entre gangsters e soldados hallie poe numa caixa para mudar de casa

A thing to notice is that earlier in *Without Me* people used to say “Guess Who’s Back” when they met. Now they say it through mobile phones. EMINEM showed the difference of technology of the generations he lived and today’s world.

This is perfection ❤

And he supports Kamala...why
C-I-N-E-M-A🤷‍♂
"America’s really gay I can’t wait to get the hell out of it cause then you guys can worship molesters and rapists and then you put Mike Tyson on a statue. He’s a rapist then you got Kobe Bryant. He is a rapist then you got 2Pac big rapist everybody from death row camp is a rapist. They admitted it. They were drug women they still brag about bribing women with money bags, luggage jewelry for sex specially notes they will give bank note for sex. Sex is free you gotta pay for it. There’s something wrong with you and if you’re taking care of more than one woman, you’re a loser."
Wow

Weird that you waxed political with Harris after a song like this... it's kina a bummer. I guess when peeps get old they get political. IDK . I do like the song though.
Was someone moaning at the start ?!
You got to be a little upset you sold out. Not Detroit at all.
Straight up.
Wait guys listen closely when this song starting😂 Em is having fun🍆🍑
Great song but way too mainstream
Non sense
3:01 the hell was bro on
Can't believe he supports kamala didn't see that coming
"Hi Em, Leanne Ryan here from Ireland 🇮🇪 looking to see how I invoice you for previous work done. 😊"
"He makes this song about how less restricted everything was when he was younger and how you could get cancelled from saying something controversial to the Left wing snowflakes.
Yet he endorses Kamala Harris…
That doesn’t make any sense."
Hi 2035 people..
"4:46 ""bruh""💀-"

Seems like i am not aging since the early 2000s cause everday i wake up it think...  What the fuck is this shit?! Just imagine the confusion of someone comming from the early 2000s to this bullshit we are living in now. 😂😂

Mitooo🎉🎉🎉

Man he should've gone harder. This is like a B version of what he use to be. Disappointing.
Ok. I remember when he first came out. This is a bad attempt to try to bring back old Eminem. He has changed and it sucks.
Eminem is good but after the endorsement of kamala Em lost respect and credibility
🤬a
The best to ever touch the mic. White boy who made it

Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"

Shouldn’t have gone political. Rep. Lost.
I'm 57... Am I the oldest Eminem fan?
"Gen X when this came out: oh you guys aren’t gonna be able to handle og Eminem, yall are way too offended nowadays 

The same guys recently: OH MY GOD WHY WOULD EMINEM SELL OUT TO KAMAL TOE HARRIS, IM NEVER LISTENING TO ANYMORE OF THIS DIDDY PARTY PARTICIPANTS MUSIC"
He's back!!!!🎉
OMFG that was great!
Dont worry im a great driver *proceeds to crash into every existing thing*
1:46 nice shoot
"Eminem>Dax 
Easily the better version is Eminem"
If I think that shit I'ma say that shit😂
50 cent is beef
"Wow! I just automatically can't stand your voice anymore bro. That's all it took. You just lost millions of us man, but you were already losing millions of us anyways. But the Harris rally thing that definitely solidified the death of your career homie"
"Makes fun of wokeness... then endorses the woke candidate. ""Sometimes i wonder what the old me'd say""... he probably wouldn't endorse either candidate but especially not the corporate media pro-war bought and owned candidate, Kamala is 2024 version of George Bush so good job becoming the thing that you hate."
I really hope Eminem sees this comment Eminem why do you look so stupid now go back to slim shady I hate your new style

How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"
Back again!
Hiiiiii❤
Guess who back 😉
Been an Eminem fan my entire life. If he feels strongly enough to publicly endorse the liar kamala harris and the deomcrat party of America then i feel strongly enough to never listen to Eminem ever again for the rest of my life. What a sell out
What he said? :DDD Nice...
Sooooo fireee💥💥💥💣💣
Whos here in 2025
Eminem is on the Diddy list and a hypocrite.  Pedophile.
Eminem is a fucking sellout democrat puppet.  Fuck him.   Ill never listen to another thing this fake ass diddy buddy say again. Fucking hypocrite.
"О, Минем ещё могёт."
❤trump❤ killed you on a rap eminem.

Nostalgia
Who is in the year 1224
We got Eminem selling out to politicians before GTA6 💀 Thats crazy 🔥
"It’s so messed up that Eminem wants to endorse Kamala. I wrote a whole speech on here about it, but it looks like YouTube silenced me unfortunately there democrats I had a lot of good points. Like the constitution the Democrats don’t like the constitution they hate it. They wish it was gone and you can just go look for yourself. Many Democrats  said that they want to change the constitution. It’s sad"
We got slim shady back before GTA 6
Eminem The GOAT 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Good

"те що я тебе слухаю ніяк не вплини на мою підтримку Трампа, цього разу я буду за нього"

A punto de convertirse en abuelo y Eminem no pierde el toque. Encima parece que en lugar de envejecer rejuvenece
4:09 AYO 😂
"Damn 22 years ago, ""Without me"" dropped and the only person that can top that was eminem itself. Ive destroyed my mom's car stereo from always blasting eminem throughout the 2000's era 😂. And now this legend came back with another banger"

Thank You Beyoncé🥺

Brings out a banger then ruins it all by supporting kamala so we dont find out hes a main attendent of diddys private partys nonce

Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da

Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like

Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro

Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""

Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)

So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo

But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit

"Welcome back,Enimem!❤"
He has tiny little legs. Ewwww
Sold out shady. Smh
😂😂😂❤❤❤
I’m gonna be dead honest I’m gonna vote for trump but will I unsubscribe from Eminem Hell No. I’ve been here since 1999 and besides anyone who just completely deleted em because of his own choices are nothing more than fair weather fans. I think completely stupid like when a team has one bad year imagine the chiefs being 2-4 right now they’ll be calling for Andy Reid’s head.
Like criminals and illegal migrant and perpetuate black crime rate. Not sure why people still keep supporting him.
anyone here? 2025?
"“Don’t worry, I JUST got my license back” 😭💀"

U r crazy goat 🐐 and I'm Indian
I LOVE YOU EMINEM
Eminem has become the biggest sell out ever. You're going to endorse Kamala who's the biggest liar of all time? I've lost all hope in you and you're fake as hell. I bet they caught you at Diddys being a sick pervert and that's why you're owned by the democrats now. I hope you rot in prison.
The best
Like him but lost respect bc he is supporting cameltoe chameleon Kamala
This is corny as hell 3:50
I’m gonna remember going to  store getting  cd  ❤
2:28 the song just stopped when he almost falled and continiue

"Heard HARDY on a hard rock station, liked it, did a bit of a rabbit-hole on what else he’s done. Never would have guessed he started as a country artist.

See - that’s the beauty of music. You never have to keep yourself in a box. That, my friends, is a message for life in general.

Hardy has a die-hard fan in me, regardless of genre he wants to do."
Such a bad song
bro they created a monstore
My cat turned on this song and started watching I swear😂😂😂😂
YASS U SHOULD CONTINUE MAKIMG MUSIC ASLONG AS UR ALIVE

"You sold yourself to psychopatic politic K.C. You know guys, artist are super until they wont get rich..."
I just realized that the Bud Light shirt was a dig at Kid Rock and all the other MAGA pukes. Em is a big brain rapper lol.

"Gonna get some hate on this,....but if you break this song down and see what he is actually saying, plus who he endorsed. Sounds good and flows great! He is brilliant in putting words together into a msg;.. but it's the wrong msg when being a 50 year old icon/father/grandfather. Most of the ole g's get it. Trump 2024."

Many don't know this song is based off the Steve Miller band song with the same name 👍
"Em should've stayed out of politics lost alot of respect for him endorsing Harris, it's like my hero sold out."
"Incrivel como o Em envelheceu como um bom vinho, ele está novo e cheio de energia !!! O tempo passou tao bem para você Marshall, você é uma lenda viva❤ ❤❤❤"
I think you just wanted to say hi to a friend. 🤍
Eminem and Dre in lambo classic
El Robin esta viejo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:10 😮
I am 62 years old and still love his music🥰
"Fucking shill bitch. pretended Slim was back then endorse Kamala? should have known. the old you would say ""Everything is gay, full of faggots"""
"He’s no longer Eminem.

He’s THEMINEM, or Miss Marshall.
Frontin’ for The Giggler."
you sold your soul to Kamala....wtf
That Shane Gillis cameo is WILD
for fk shake i love this!
"i love how this sinks up with ""without me"""
"Well my thoughts are shattered, that you were different than the rest of the celebrities.  To endorse the BS of democrats is unbelievable.  Really thought you guys were all different and smarter than that.  Agenda and lies galore doesn't matter, I guess."
4:15
we got real slim shad back before GTA VI
Happy to see m is back to his old antics
Absolutely love this song 🥲
@megantheestalion
Hey....i love you SHADY...❤
Harris supporter bro really
JESUS IS BACK
"Imagine making songs about how stupid woke culture is, just to go ahead and endorse it right after. SMH. Dum dum. Wokinem."
Tom McDonald collab would be great.
"Should of used that chance to come up with a character, like a fused eminem and slim shady type sheet"
It's just amazing that EZ Mil is part of the video ❤
Eminem is a CLOWN.
"Ich liebe ihn....Sehr talentiert und immer gegen den Strom. Und viel Humor ...kann über sich selbst lachen. Unsere Kindheit/ Jugend ähnelt sich. Hut ab, alle Probleme bewältigt zu haben."
I love this song 😍
i hear something in the start?? 😳
Back to when you could actually rapping about every fucking thing without this shit of politically correct! Em the best rapper since the day one for fuck sake!!
2:45 well done! You just put your ears through complete torture
This album is the realest one. I wish more rappers could speak the truth about whats really going on instead of sex and revenge
"shit man, nodding my head whit a big smile,, great stuff go get em!! and like that he is back bruh"
Steve Mill*r right?
"Let us imagine how hip-hop will be if 1, Eminem never rapped..
2, Eminem wasn't white and 3, Eminem dies...
Think on that all you haters and all the racist mother-fluffers"

This rap song is actually really sad. Feel bad for him.
"You can't rap against woke pc culture and then support it while crying in front of millions . Not only are you a sellout , you're hypocritical with zero self awareness . Since you support abortion and illegal immigrants so much then maybe you should talk Hailey into getting an abortion . Practice what you preach you hypocritical sellout ."
This sucks…
I want a doggo ❤
"""You vs Yourself"" ahh moment 😭"
I love the scene when Julio Cesar Chavez jr. Take the Lambo with Eminem inside 😂😂😂😂😂
"All the people screaming SeLLoUt obviously don’t know about “The Storm” song against TrumP in 2017. Check the lyrics. “ And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his
I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against”
He doesn’t want YoUr MoNeY. Maybe he’ll give you a refund if you bought an album since then. And also, this song is irony."
I love you Eminem❤️
His scream At 1:33
"Gosto de ouvir todas as músicas do EMINEM, e para você que está aqui ouvindo essa música, e que também gosta de ouvir todas as músicas do EMINEM, eu desejo que você esteja em Paz"
SELLOUT
Sorry but the old Em would NeVER endorse Kamala Harris 😂😂😂 u playing us all right slim ? oh I forgot u sold out years ago 😂😂😂😂😂 n the rhymes have not been anywhere as good since 😂
❤
Trump 2024
Diddy parties and pedo island...
"Love you slim, B rabbit, Eminem, Marshall"
This is so creative
I love you !
where's our slim shady i want that fast mouth
and that's why tyler the creator had blond hair
"He's a white males for cumala
. Studio gangsta. So really, everything about him is a FRAUD. he's just a celebrity puppet on a string. He has no value or worth, if he did he'd be with in line with others that TRULY resisted the system. Not being mean, but if you feel what his ""art"" says you need to check yourself. You are headed for destruction. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. he's a fraud, fooling ALL who intake his feces he calls music. He's been in the garbage since 01. Making nothing but trash."
The last time I heard this song it had 162 million views now it has 172💀💀
"Eminem is a degenerate beta male

https://youtu.be/FOksytvcuHI?si=jm55_NdvULxHGiXt"
Steve Miller Yeah !!!

"Old ass sellout, hope that blue money worth losing your fans."
❤
💯💯💯💯💯💯
What the fuck is this shit . Never nailed more then that
🐐
"2:47 Its so funny that this sentence can mean either the 2000's Em or 2024 Em 😂 From 2000's Em pov, 2024 Em is 'the old me'. While from 2024 Em pov, 2000's Em is 'the old me'"
1:30 I wanna know what material that car is made of
yo suckers
"Eminem sucks, after watching the Harris rally. I hate Eminem now."
Eminem IS gettin old...Back in the days he Only Point Out whats wrong with politicians....and nowadays he Go Hand in Hand with them really Said to See someone Like him turning into a bitch of this policial system...the world IS falling down
"Mit den dunklen Haaren absolut megaaa, die Musik schon  immer megaaaa"
So he is now on the same side as Bush and Chengy.
"I think the Fusion of ""new"" and ""old"" Shady looks like the ""Dante"" in the ""Devil may Cry"" Reboot... Do anyone see it? ;) Well I like this song"
🎉🎉🎉🎉 hello marvel to come to my house
This video just over took  Kendrick not like us (audio) on YouTube 😮

Dear Eminem stick to rapping stay out of politics
"No way, fuckin Classified is in this video. Thats fuckin awesome!!"
"guess who's bakc, back again!"

His music is so bad now. The Eminem show was the only thing worth listening to
Yo damn bro
Dr. Dre photos above m&m's bed 😅
I think I like it

slim shady coming back after eminem endorsed kamala
What a crazy video😮
Whos here to watch his career suicide with Kamala?
EMINEM IS A INSECT 😂😂
Wtf i just watch right now 😂
The best ❤ I don't know how you can say It is bad everyone is going crazy not going to lie
Ǝminem never fails to drop bangers
"Earth is a mixture of heaven and hell and people are angels and demons with demons being pdophiles and when an angel dies they think they will automatically be reborn and when someone abuses a baby instead of getting reborn they become a spirit that wanders and the sea means cease to exist but what demons have been doing is forcing angels to abuse it doesnt matter if its there choice then pulling there eyes out and giving them brain damage so as a spirit nobody finds the sea and in the future earth becomes hell fire and actually lasts eternity put the two ""gods"" on a lie detector and ask if there is an angel going hell there is including a baby out the demons like most rappers eminem etc"
dude piss on you.  the last 4 years has broken us.  the cost of living is through the roof.  I'm sure it doesn't affect you but it affects us.  We aren't rich.  They are trying to take everything from us and you support the machine.
Eminem + Slim Shady = Sleminem
Nah the album on all the songs should say slim shady ft Eminem
Cool so 💖💖🌏🌏🦋🐬😊🐬
Guys its been 4 months and i already feel nostalgic 😭😭
Slim Shady hates Trump! Like he said we don't want someone like Trump who threatens retribution.  Free America from Trump!
"You dumb fukwit, you put out this track that is anti woke and get the most attention that you have ever got and now you are indorsing Harris the person who wants to push woke on everyone. You fukwit just go away."
EM why you be dissing your own kids
"Just remember, this is eminem at 50 percent.  Rapboy gonna turn into rap god."
"Un génie du RAP US ! 

Tu ne peux pas test 😮

Eminem c’est … quand il se concentre sur un disque… on ne l’arrête pas ! 

C’est un Mozart urbain ! 

Quelle chance d’avoir ce talent !"
reminds me of this song; https://youtu.be/RXE222oKTGc
“I haven’t seen slim shady and eminem in the same room” mfs after seeing this
"THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE PROBABLY SUPPORTING KAMALA IS BCUZ TRUMP IS PLANNING TO READ THE NAMES OFF THE LIST... USHER OBAMA AND YOU ARE ON THEM I BET... IF YOU MAKE HER PRESIDENT, SHE NEVER LEAK YOUR NAMES BUT WAIT THERE'S A GIRL ON TIKTOK CLAIMING THAT WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG, SHE WAS KIDNAPPED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SHE HAS SAID.... ASK ME ABOUT OBAMA"
Why did he put P Davidson in there
Who is here in October 24
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
This song was cool until Eminem became a political pawn. Death of Slim Shady is about right... 😂
"Came here after the Detroit Rally to see the comment and oh People, you don’t get it—he’s an artist! He’s free to have his political opinions, but as long as his art is good, I don’t care! I’ll still listen to Kid Rock and Eminem because music and politics are separate. I don’t need to share someone’s political views to appreciate their art."
muito bom

No one gonna talk 0:04 backround noise 💀💀💀💀
My favorite part to be honest😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Caca. .💩
Why did he have to endorse Kamala???
Sellout!
Eminem rekindles my faith in humanity. I hated him at first. but I was a teacher in high school and he was brighter than me.
"Lyrical genius , cos he's white he'll never be fully appreciated in that circle , only those who HEAR it , appreciate it , but racism isn't even mentioned when black artists dis-regard him , being the best artist of that genre burns them , and I've noticed the ones who don't rate him are all over the dark web getting drilled out 😂 Fiddy , Slim and the top g Dre , churning out rhymes still to this day , humble with no guilt ....jay z get your head bk under P's quilt .....🫡🫣😂😉"
"Well, unsubscribed now as it looks like I am no longer a fan of yours ! 
You walked away ...to join the thieves, liars, warmongers and  perverts. 
Poor judgment indeed"
He is getting dissed soon.
Old Shady Slim 😢😮😢
This Eminem lost his nuts when endorsing Kamala
ICONIC
"Always interesting when the ""anti-establishment"" guy sells out and joins the establishment to criticize others who don't side with him and who he thinks you should support, vote for, etc."
Eminem at it again. Dissing the clown world.
We needed some Eminem in this generation
Trump 2024 baby
"Hey, Em, it's Paul
Uh, I was listening to the album
Good fucking luck, you're on your own
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da
Well, look what the stork brung (what?)
Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)
Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat?
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro
Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my God, it's him, not again""
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro (break it down)
Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)
So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini
I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving like
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick)
I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh (like)
Abra-abracadabra (and for my last trick, poof)
Just like that and I'm back, bro"

We all know slim shady will always be alive and same as Eminem and he's both  he's Eminem Slim  Shady  that's him he has both sides
It's definitely the suicide of slim shady when you endorse Kamala
Yeah😊
"This guy speaking at the Kamala Harris rally, he’s a clown He use to be anti establishment which made him a millionaire and now he’s one of them. Who would have thought. Amazing!all the gay bashing he did in the 90s and now he’s for LGBTQ gang. Not like us"
Holy shit 171 million M&M is a fucking legend!!!!
Eminem fabricated his past and kim was adopted by debbie when she ran away at 14 🤮 she is like his step sister 🤢
Nomaree .. Had missed slim shady..Hee am Soo old
Slim shady dancing 😂

Candu bjir lagunya
"Wow.   Stumping for Harris, Marshall?    Never had you pegged for a tool of the establishment.   But here we are..."
Eminem wearing BUD LIGHT.....really??
"You're my favorite singer, and my favorite rapper"

Another compromised guy from Diddy forced to make this song for year of the election!
"now i know where i hear this song, it's on movie:Sing 2 that's means this song was in made since 2021"
Cry me a river maga 😂 Harris 2024 💙
Hala Madrid🤍💙
sick
Not listen to a his music anymore taken him off my play list on u tub. Found out that he's voting for Harris.   Trump 2024
"Damn, you spewed all this hot shit just 4 months ago and now you became practically a lesbian with just making a spot with Harris."
He's on the diddy list
Is paul abit sensitive
EMINEM SHOULD DONATE TO TRUMP ELECTION SAME WITH SNOOP N DR DRE. WOOPIE N ELLEN N MANY MORE
"""Guess who back shrek is back"""
What happened to no repercussions for our opinions sick of these lies
55seconds EZ MIL😊
Okay then fast as fuk boy wow
"He's awesome. Calls out literally EVERYONE!!   has the support of the best rap artists of all times that ""are still alive"" 🤷‍♀️ I love it!! ❤
We all know Em is Bi and that's ok.
At least he is honest."
"What a disappointment you are 😞 You support the murder of Ukrainians and chaos in the world. I have loved you since childhood, and now you support people who destroy Ukraine. You are a disgrace!!"
"Eminem, you are just as fake as all the people you've dissed over the years.I would never have thought that you would sell out like you did the other day.I will never listen to your music again. Your music was a staple against the elites and the  Fascist media. You say you make up your own lyrics and stuff.Well now i'm having hard doubts about that and lots of things you've said Rabbit."
Shocking to see Eminem go from mosh back to another Kim
Still in shock to see him at a kamala rally ...😂
"So he raps about the woke left, then joins them"
Now we know who to side with.  Eminem endorses  jamala harry I mean kamala harrus.  Eat crap 💩 Eminem. Loser.  Machine gun Kelly is now cool.
The music video on the street self is super good
Wokeminem
Harris got Eminem Trump got Kid Rock 😅
Eminem's the kind of guy that fights himself and win at both sides
"Eminem for Tampon Tim Walz and Kama, la 😂😂 🤡"
4:15 Hayley ate that part
Eminem is cringe at its finest
tf is this shit 🤣
So Paul tried to talk him out of voting4 kamala.. As usual he's on his own.
Heard just lose it laught at 1:35
STILL VOTING TRUMP!
"They must have blackmail tapes on Em for him to support Harris. He disses all politicians. To see him supporting one is definitely forced with a ""or else."" Shame"
"Best Rapper of all time .....He's the true Rap God , hopefully one day I meet him"
I’m happy to see he still had his sense of humor 😂
P....Rabbit 😁
Make a diss on Mr.savage about your Fortnite 1v1 against him
This fruit just jumped the shark and endorsed the Cackler.
Will even him is using vanoss in the title😂
Shit is wack.  Wow.
bang emi kocak juga
"guys, shadys back!

em: tell a friend."
"Yeah, and you are too, but you just don't know it! We are our own worst enemies! Look up, ""shaking my head productions,"""
"イマシカ（日本のyoutuber）を見てから 0:28 を見ると
「Ｆランジャーン！？×8  ハハｯ（バカにした笑い）」に聞こえてくる"
"Eminem ficou tão cansado de ganha brigas...
Então agora ele está lutando contra sim meusmo 😅🤙"
We saw slim shady reancranted but he has horns and a snake tounge
Dose anyone wana be my friend
"What a joke, this song contradicts itself so much especially after he promotes kamala hamas....  I lost all respect i ever had for him!"
"Sounds like he's against woke, then goes and supports Woke Queen Kamala. Which is it? Id rather have 50 cent than melted M&Ms"
"Eminem is the biggest punk sellout on the planet, what you scared of Em? You read that Kamala script like your freedom was on the line, almost as if your name was on a list somewhere yo! You may have enough money to live though a Kamala administration but most people don't have 250 million to fall back on, and the people you claim need help are the ones being hurt by Kamala, Trump made things affordable, made the border safe, crime was down and he put money in people pockets. It is almost as if you don't want things to change. You sold out son,,, deal with it."
You can always tell a champ they choice wisely any challenger. World knows I can rap dick slap no wrap this tapped equivalent rap crap big sap  big bat it's only matt
Notice how he will never call me out. Cause they know I'm the best rap nerd ever. Plus I got the borze to house
When you got more then 200 million followers then Eminem and my friend barrows my stuff
Time been ruff ruff
They are not the same person one has an older daughter one has a younger daughter💀💀💀
Trump
I love the song
"Eminem supported Kamala Harris? And he used to be such a regular, cool white guy... Such a shame, man.:("
Justice hasn’t been served yet for 2Pac and Biggy. Let’s hope Puffy/Diddy/Sean John gets what he deserves. Unfortunately for him there will no lube or drugs in prison. 🥳🫶🏼
"Legends still legends no matter how many years passed, no matter how old they get legends will always be legends. 💪🏻🙌🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🔥🐐💯👑"
"Eminem is just a legend, somebody give him a Nobel legend Price"
How did they bring back 2000 Eminem?
Shane Gillis? Em got the dawgs out
never really liked his music but this is fire😝

Imagine being a millionaire and complaining that the guy trying to fix the country (who has never taken a penny for doing so btw)has never had to struggle meanwhile everyone else is struggling in the current admin. You sir are brainwashed.
Feminem
Feminem
Feminem
Cancel culture has been heavy for the last four years. Dude talks about you shouldn’t be afraid to voice your opinion. While endorsing the party that has ruined this country the last 4 years.
"eminem, you stoned b1tch, go support Scumbagala"
Feminem endorses Kamala Harris and dresses in drag. Dude went from verbally assaulting people like that to joining them. Feminem lost a fan today. Listened since his first LP and you lost me.
"First the death of Slim Shady, now the return and then death again"
The best men!
It's gets so fire after 1:00
Welcome bq
"That is the clone Eminem fighting with the spirit of the real Eminem that they killed back 10 years ago. He couldn’t be controlled. So they killed him and cloned him and taught his clone the way of the agenda, that the real Eminem refused to accept."
34 years later still rockin!
😂
The goat returned
The democrats have a diddy tape on him https://youtu.be/BjTPOafg9GE?si=B9fE2266-rTc5fMD
i love this song ♥♥
https://youtu.be/BjTPOafg9GE?si=B9fE2266-rTc5fMD
"Hes a industry puppet.  Whack rhymes.  What a joke the whole industry is.. whack rappers.  Your city has been failing for decades and you back the same people destroying it, WHAT A SIMP"
"What a loser, you actually back kamala the clown, wow. Now we know where you stand. They paod you alot to support harris.."
"All this anti woke and anti censorship shit in this album is just posing. Look up what this bundle of sticks said at the Harris rally. He either doesn’t understand anything he wrote about in this album or doesn’t actually believe in it. Marshal has boomer syndrome, he just wants to relive his golden days and he can’t say anything about the liberals irl because Haley would be mad. Boo hoo. Just lost half of your fan base."
"Feminem, washed up corporate loser."
"Living on past glory’s Em, I’m afraid this is total dog sh!t to the Mathers EP’s. That ivory Tower has softened you for the worse."
⭐👑👽
"If i came across myself, i would spoil my entire life."
Legend back ^^
this is the best slim shaddy song the rest are garbage truth be told at least its catchy
عرفنا انك ماسوني
Jimmy Iovine killed hip hop.  Jimmy Iovine raped kids at Diddy's.  Eminem used his democrat connections to cover it up.
"Wait...  If ""Eminem"" and Slim Shady are the same person but with different personalities, how did he put Slim shady on the music? Because Slim Shady isn't the young version of ""Eminem?"
Happy birthday🎉🎉
"Even Eminem sould his soul to the devil, happens."
"""Like happy!"" 
I'm so glad Eminem got the help he needed and kept evolving his music. He just keeps getting better and better."
The old Eminem is somewhat like a rock
Eminem got robbed again. He should've won Best Video at the VMAS.
Gay...
I wish I could like this video again and again and again and again sometimes I have to unlike just to like again. ❤❤❤❤
This isn't gonna end well for you.. everything you said was a lie and you never changed.
Maybe not all modern music is bad
Pete from the rookie?
Love that he makes this song about everyone turning into Girl Scouts and handing out participation trophies. Then goes up on stage to introduce Harris and waltz. What a douche.
that Pete Davidson cameo was unexpectedly fresh :D
Legend! He never grow old. Even in  this generation his lyrics hits. The last part is also funny 🤣 Been listening to this many times now.
0:16
Enminem is king clown.

"2:43 This is either a really impressive Deep Fake (not likely) or Time Travel. 
I’m going with the ladder. That would mean that he really is Rap God. 
And to follow up on that, his music may never go into the Public Domain."
Trump 2024. Lol
Missed the chance to title this Eminem ft. Slim Shady 💔
Love the aghahaha when they fightin lol
They created sliminem
"GUESS WHOS BACK WITH THIS ONE 🔥 






Umm its my ""joke"" was not funny 😔"
Trailer of how to breathe probably
Dang E ! I'm 68 and absolutely looove your musique  ! Merci beaucoup...🤍
The black hair do not suit him
Break It Down 🪄🎩
🤣er ist beim bumsen🤣😅😋🤣
I like it how they did a CGI of Eminem as Slim shady and as himself
Next he will endorse Trump.
Boy is this trash retire from rap my brother
He got jealous of me
Super badass.
I'm sorry.This is an old video I think this country needs to and if you wanna talk to me you know where to get at
Not that good old tho
FUCK EMINEM! He's a Democrat! Piss on him.
Eminem endorsing Kamala is a joke. What a sellout
Actually 50 cent & Trick trick both support Trump
"Trump has the entire US military. Eminem has 5/6 of D12, 50 cent, Trick trick, and Dre"
"Marshall, Eminem, Shady. Call yourself whatever. He schools every form of you"
"Eminem you're great, but Trump completely kicks your ass"
Milinial is back
Eminem about to take an L for Kamala. What an idiot!
"Dawg, you don't have to support crazy kamala, just finish cleaning out your closet and come out that mf, it's ok bru, or sis or whatever you identify AS 😊"
My
W
Cool danke schön 🌏💖💖🦋🐺🐬
"It's true, I bought girl scout cookies off boy girl scouts tf?"
Petite référence à machine gun Kelly avec le bébé diable. C est un tueur Eminem 🤣
Guess who's back
Long time Eminem fan 170 million views in 4 months is truly insane! Long live the GOAT
"3:30, That's not slim shady, THAT'S SLIM MATTERS! 






















I thought he was just a legend i tell my child to make him become the doctor"
"Dj thai : ""cikkicuu"" (soundtrack film ABC song)"
"The beat, and I think the chords too, stolen from ""The Reachers"", right? Love potion #9?"
History repeats itself Em and Dre destroying the internet again 🤣
This is the one vid of dissing megan thee station?
Bober kur*a 🇵🇱
Mom's spaghetti 🍝
Eminem++++++++++++++++++ requeton
Who's those ladies
"Manchmal wünsche ich mir ich wäre auch Amerikaner , dann würde ich es vielleicht verstehen , aber klingt richtig gut"
"Too sophisticate for the young generation, too much word , word play and lyrics with sense"
1:45 what the heck
3:04 💀
Nice😊
"Fuck my mind

garbage as always
No. 1 of. All time
It almost seems like Eminem and Slim Shady used the potara  earrings to become Em shady😅
Another great hit! Thanks bro!
this was 100% his best music video
Wait are Pete & MGK not friends now?
4:13 “F*ck drake”
They created monster sounds familiar
"Me parece una canción débil, adulterada, y muy ordinaria. Disculpen mis malos modales, pero  a Steve Miller seguro que no le gusta."
Did Rick and Morty come back from the past and give past Eminem the portal gun???
Ez mill
Slim shady
❤
Cant get enough
Hey maggot. It's shady.
💢💢💯💯💯💯💯💥💥
10/9.5
With all that is coming out - it is fascinating to see how eminem put a clear divide between himself and his shady avatar.
who's here after hearing that this vid overtook NLU 💀😂
My frist hip hop cd eminem show! Em is back❤❤
This is so fire
Em done beat everyone else up. He was so bored he came for himself lol😂😂😂 love you shady🎉
Why Dr Dre is gone and that long ass b*** shows up? I don't get it!

Earth angel saved me x❤
Eminem needs to make a show because this video was awesome
"1:13 no one can notice it's Ryan  keely 😂😂😂
She is pornography star"
Just so weird that the word he says the most is niggah. You would think people grow up at some point. Without that this would be a masterpiece
Bro the dead get out of the graves to stop this 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
"""dafuq is this shit?!""

"I love it and learnt it since it got released, I speak spanish, but not so good in English. It tool me 1 month to learn it at all. Thank you Eminem, is my dream be with you one day. Greetings from Perú.
Sorry for Bad English writing 😅"
"1:45 
Bit up close and personal, huh."
"Eminem is the Legend, swallow that and let that sink in. 💯"
no hate but eminem has lost some of his essence
I know someone already said it but he's so done with the fake ass rappers he's battling himself
3:14 Like HAPPY!!
3:08 If he could see sh*t the way she is today he probably say that everything is gay

3:03 Sometimes I wonder what the old me say
"solo decir es increíble,  oye porque no vienes a país Vasco ajaja. Déjate caer por España pero en el norte jajaja 😂 sólo decirte, i love it."

"Abracadabra by Steve Miller Band, this is what Em's beat was sampled"

Skididi fortnite beyonce diddy

Next month I'm one of richest person on earth. That 400mill hits couple billion . Trust me it's cool to be uncool. And hating just makes you look pathetic weak and classlessness. Everyone knows this but it's unspoken. For the record they come to me or use my name do I bother with them???? So sad. I get it but fade out clowns times up join or who's that guy again you know one that stocked me"
